# Statistical Joy Starts Here
Hello! If you happen to came across this page, it might very well be a statistically significant event... Sorry for abusing the stastical jargon, but I am so excited to share some of my statistical work with you. I love learning languages; but Statistics to me is a language of science like no other. For me personally, this means that I can use this special language to reach and engage with a broader community at large, and, if I "speak" this language appropriately, there is hope that I can fulfill my dream of making the world a better place -- even ever so slightly.

I love this quote because, as "statisitcally smart" as some of us might be, our behaviors are not completely governed by exact science or reasonings. We are human beings, and as such, our emotions often guide us through difficult times when rationales can only do so much.

## But We Still Can and Should Invoke Reasoning

We are fortunate enough to be in a time when the statistical science has advanced to such a point where quantatative reasoning and decision making can be formed based on the vast amount of empirical data humans have accumulated (and are still generating as the clock ticks!).

The joy of statistics and data science comes from and revolves around invoking rigorous reasoning on any domain of interest that has data available, and trying to see through the often messy and complex data and discover the scientific truth that underlies them. As a recent graduate, I am fortunate enough to have derived joy of this kind through various projects, an incomplete list of which is as follows:

### Applied

*   Data Visualiaztion
*   Multivariate Analysis
*   Statistical Learning
*   Regression and Generalized Regression Models
*   Experimental Design
*   Sampling Methods
*   and more

Although never the focus of GitHub, the importance of theoretical underpinnings for any applied statistical work (or any quantatative work) can never be overstated. For brevity we can say that they are roughly:

### Theoretical

* Math
* Stastical Theory

But the beauty of the statistical discipline is that there is almost always a "bridge" that can connect the two pillars: the applied person and the theretical person can almost surely meet halfway through that bridge. The job of the statistician is then, leveraging on their rigorous education, to find this bridge, and conduct quality statistical work that is conformable to the data while faithful to the truth.
